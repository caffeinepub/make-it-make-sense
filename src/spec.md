# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Simplify the AuthGate design-principles text to a single sentence.

**Planned changes:**
- Update AuthGate to remove the existing multi-line Design Principles list.
- Render exactly one user-facing line on the Auth screen: “You restate what you’re already telling yourself.”

**User-visible outcome:** On the authentication screen, users see only the single sentence design-principle line instead of the previous six-line list, with no other text changes.
